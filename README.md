# gameOfLife

  A PyGame-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life. 
  
  More specifically, it utilizes the same cellular automata principle, but also allows you to change the rules to differ from Conway's original ruleset. Also features cyclic boundaries, meaning that the cells wrap around the borders and can 'travel' the field. In the file, the constants may be adjusted to change the speed of the game, as well as the size of the field. The field can be any orthogonal shape.

#The current implementation is written in a very messy, spaghetti way. Will be refactored into a more readable state later down the line.
